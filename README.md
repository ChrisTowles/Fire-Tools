# Fire Tools
Fire Tools is a powerful collection of tools that helps debloat and install Google services on your Fire Tablet to make it feel snappier and improve usability. Additionally, it supports custom launchers such as Nova, Lawnchair, or anyÂ `.apk(m)`. If you need to install multiple apps quickly, there's a batch installer. It's as easy as dropping all your `.apk(m)`s in the Batch folder and clicking the Batch Install button!

**Fire OS 7.3.2.2+ Users: Some functions may not work, such as Custom Launcher, but most packages will still be disabled**

- Google Apps are downloaded from [ApkMirror](https://www.apkmirror.com/) and are included in releases for convienence. See [terms](https://github.com/mrhaydendp/Fire-Tools/blob/main/Fire-Tools/Gapps/README.md) 
- Debloat will disable most amazon apps with the exception of: `Calculator`, `Camera`, `Clock`, `Files`, `Fire Launcher`, `Silk Browser`, and `Settings`
